<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing Oil-Fired Furnace</li><li>Oil Fired Indirect Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Condensing oil-fired furnaces are highly efficient heating systems that extract more heat from the combustion process, resulting in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. They are ideal for larger homes or buildings. Oil-fired indirect heaters are used to provide supplemental heat in conjunction with a primary furnace or boiler. They heat a separate fluid, such as water or glycol, which is then circulated through a heat exchanger to deliver warm air throughout a space. Both types of oil furnaces offer effective heating solutions for various applications.</p></p>
