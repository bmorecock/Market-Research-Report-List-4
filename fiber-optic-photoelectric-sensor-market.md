<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse-reflective Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic photoelectric sensors are categorized into three main types: through-beam sensors, retro-reflective sensors, and diffuse-reflective sensors. Through-beam sensors consist of a separate transmitter and receiver placed opposite each other to detect when an object interrupts the beam. Retro-reflective sensors use a reflector to bounce the beam back to the sensor. Diffuse-reflective sensors have a single unit that emits and receives the light, detecting objects by measuring the amount of light reflected back. Each type has its own unique applications and advantages.</p></p>
