<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fetal Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fetal monitors are used to track the health and development of the baby during pregnancy. There are two main types of fetal monitors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors involve inserting a probe into the uterus to directly measure the baby's heart rate and other vital signs. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, use sensors placed on the mother's abdomen to track the baby's heartbeat and movements without any internal intervention. Both types of monitors play a crucial role in ensuring the well-being of the baby during pregnancy.</p></p>
