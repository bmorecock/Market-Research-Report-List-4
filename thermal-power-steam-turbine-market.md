<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Power Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Back Pressure</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal power steam turbine market can be segmented into three types based on their operating conditions and applications: condensing, back pressure, and others. Condensing turbines are typically used in power plants where steam is exhausted at low pressures, while back pressure turbines are used in industrial processes to generate both power and heat. The "others" category includes specialty turbines designed for specific applications such as cogeneration and combined heat and power plants. Each type offers different efficiency and performance characteristics based on their design and operating parameters.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Thermal Power Steam Turbine Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Thermal Power Plant</li><li>Open-air Thermal Power Plant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal power steam turbines are used in both closed and open-air thermal power plants for electricity generation. Closed thermal power plants use a closed-loop system to recirculate water and steam, while open-air plants use an open-loop system that releases steam into the environment. Both types of plants rely on thermal power steam turbines to convert the energy from steam into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electricity through a generator. These applications are essential for meeting the energy demands of various industries and communities.</p></p>
