<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perforating Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP Type</li><li>TCP Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perforating guns are tools used in the oil and gas industry to create holes in well casings for improved production. There are two main types of perforating guns: WCP (Wireline Conveyed Perforating) and TCP (Tubing Conveyed Perforating). WCP guns are typically used when the well is already established and require wireline services for operation. TCP guns, on the other hand, are used when the well is being drilled and the perforating gun is conveyed through the tubing string. Both types of guns play a crucial role in enhancing well productivity.</p></p>
