<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The City Surveillance Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras are connected to a central network video recorder (NVR) and are typically used for large-scale surveillance systems where multiple cameras are needed. Decentralized IP cameras, on the other hand, have built-in storage and processing capabilities, allowing them to function independently without the need for a central NVR. Decentralized cameras are more commonly used for smaller installations or in scenarios where flexibility and scalability are important. Both types of cameras are widely used in city surveillance systems to monitor public spaces and enhance safety and security.</p></p>
