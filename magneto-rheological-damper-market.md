<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magneto-Rheological Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Damper</li><li>Semi Active Damper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magneto-Rheological Damper market types consist of Active Damper and Semi-Active Damper. Active dampers are controlled electronically and adjust in real time to provide optimal damping for changing road conditions, maximizing comfort and handling. Semi-active dampers are also electronically controlled, but do not have the ability to actively adjust damping levels. Instead, they rely on preset settings or user inputs to provide a more adaptive damping experience. Both types offer improved ride quality and handling compared to traditional passive dampers.</p></p>
