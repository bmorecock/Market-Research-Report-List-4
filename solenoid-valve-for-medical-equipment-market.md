<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solenoid Valve for Medical Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting</li><li>Pilot Operated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solenoid valves for medical equipment come in two main types: direct acting and pilot operated. Direct acting solenoid valves use the force generated by the solenoid to open and close the valve directly, making them simple and efficient. On the other hand, pilot operated solenoid valves use a small pilot valve to control the flow of fluid through a larger main valve, allowing for higher flow rates and pressures. Both types are commonly used in medical equipment such as ventilators, fluid control systems, and anesthesia machines.</p></p>
