<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Anti-strip Promoters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amine Anti-Stripping Agent</li><li>Amine-free Anti-stripping Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asphalt anti-strip promoters can be categorized into two main types: amine anti-stripping agents and amine-free anti-stripping agents. Amine anti-stripping agents contain a type of organic compound known as amines, which enhance the adhesion between asphalt and aggregates, reducing the risk of moisture-induced damage. On the other hand, amine-free anti-stripping agents utilize alternative chemical compounds to achieve the same result without the use of amines. Both types of anti-strip promoters aim to improve the overall performance and durability of asphalt pavements.</p></p>
