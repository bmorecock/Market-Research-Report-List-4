<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Grounding System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistance Grounded Systems</li><li>Solidly Grounded Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resistance Grounded Systems entail connecting the neutral point of a power system to ground through a resistor to limit fault currents. This system reduces the risk of equipment damage and fire hazards. Solidly Grounded Systems, on the other hand, have no intentional impedance between the neutral point and ground. This system allows for quicker fault identification but may lead to higher fault currents and increased risk of equipment damage. Both types of grounding systems play a crucial role in electrical safety and system protection.</p></p>
