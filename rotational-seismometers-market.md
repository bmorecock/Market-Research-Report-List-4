<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotational Seismometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Three-axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotational seismometers are devices used to measure rotational ground motion during earthquakes. There are two main types available in the market: single axis and three-axis seismometers. Single axis seismometers measure motion in one direction, while three-axis seismometers measure motion in three orthogonal directions. Single axis seismometers are typically more cost-effective and easier to install, whereas three-axis seismometers provide more comprehensive data and a better understanding of the earthquake's impact from all directions. Both types play an important role in monitoring seismic activity and ensuring early warning systems are in place.</p></p>
