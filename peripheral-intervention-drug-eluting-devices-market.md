<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-Eluting Balloons</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral intervention drug-eluting devices are used to treat narrowed or blocked blood vessels in the peripheral arteries. Two main types include drug-eluting balloons (DEB) and drug-eluting stents (DES). DEB are coated with a medication that is released to prevent the vessels from re-narrowing after balloon angioplasty. DES are stents coated with medication to prevent restenosis. Both types of devices help to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of complications in patients with peripheral artery disease.</p></p>
