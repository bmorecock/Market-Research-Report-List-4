<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Resistant and Retardant Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent Flame Resistant and Retardant Fabric</li><li>Treated Flame Resistant and Retardant Fabric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame resistant and retardant fabrics can be categorized into two main types: inherent and treated. Inherent fabrics are naturally flame resistant due to the chemical structure of the fibers used in their production, providing long-lasting protection. On the other hand, treated fabrics have been chemically treated to enhance their flame resistance properties. While both types offer protection against fire hazards, inherent fabrics are generally preferred for their durability and longevity, while treated fabrics may be more cost-effective for certain applications.</p></p>
