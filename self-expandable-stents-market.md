<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Memory Alloy</li><li>Non Memory Alloy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self expandable stents are commonly classified into two types - Memory Alloy and Non-Memory Alloy. Memory Alloy stents are made of materials that can return to a predetermined shape after being deformed, providing consistent support. Non-Memory Alloy stents, on the other hand, are made of materials that do not have shape memory properties but still offer effective stabilization. Both types of stents are widely used in medical procedures such as angioplasty and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure.</p></p>
