<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Mechanical Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical mechanical ventilators market can be categorized into two main types: non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators deliver oxygen to the lungs without the need for intubation, making them less invasive and more comfortable for patients. Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, require the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen directly into the lungs. Both types of ventilators are crucial in providing respiratory support to patients with breathing difficulties.</p></p>
